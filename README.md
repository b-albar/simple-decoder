## Introduction

This is a simple and optimized decoder architecture for sequence generation tasks. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with a focus on speed and efficiency.
It is designed to support optimized kernels as well as various type of objectives such as the Prefix-LM objective.
Also it will support different type of attention such as differential attention.

## TODOs

- [ ] Support for differential attention
- [ ] Support for Prefix-LM objective
